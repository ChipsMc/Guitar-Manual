## Anatomy of the Les Paul

Let’s begin by getting to know the parts that make up your Les Paul, as well as some basic terminology.

### Mapping Out Your Les Paul

Your guitar can be divided into three sections: the headstock, neck, and body.  Each section has components that play a role in the playing, tuning, set up, and tone of your guitar.  You may notice some cosmetic differences between your guitar and the one pictured in this guide, but all of the same components will be present.

### The Headstock

The distinctive headstock with the Gibson logo and Les Paul’s signature is unmistakable.  This is where you control the tuning of your strings.  There are four important features to be aware of.

#### Machine Heads

The machine heads are the metal pegs that the strings wrap around.

#### Tuning Keys

The tuning keys are used to tune the guitar.  Turning these keys will tighten or loosen the strings, thereby altering their pitch.

#### Truss Rod Cover

The truss rod cover is a small plastic cover at the base of the headstock with two screws.  Carefully remove the screws to lift off the cover and expose the truss rod end. We will go into more detail on this in our chapter on set up.

**Caution:** Adjusting the truss rod is tricky and can damage the guitar if done incorrectly.

#### Nut

The nut is the piece at the base of the headstock that guides your strings onto the machine heads.  The six notches hold the strings in place, keeping them parallel to each other and evenly spaced.

### The Neck
